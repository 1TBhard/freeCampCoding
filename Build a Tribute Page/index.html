					<h3>Who is He?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								Sejong the Great(15 May 1397 – 8 April 1450) was the fourth king
								of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. He was the third son of King
								Taejong and Queen consort Min. He was designated as
								heir-apparent, Crown Prince, after his older brother Prince
								Yangnyeong was stripped of his title.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Sejong reinforced Confucian policies and enacted major "legal
								amendments" (공법; 貢法). He also personally created and
								promulgated the Korean alphabet Hangul,[2][3] encouraged
								advancements of scientific technology, and instituted many other
								efforts to stabilize and improve prosperity. He dispatched
								military campaigns to the north and instituted the Samin policy
								(사민정책; 徙民政策) to attract new settlers to the region. To
								the south, he subjugated Japanese pirates and captured Tsushima
								Island (also known as Daema Island in the Korean language).
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								During his reign from 1418 to 1450, he governed along with his
								father, the King Emeritus Taejong from 1418 to 1422, then
								governing as the sole monarch from 1422 to 1450. Since 1442, the
								king was increasingly ill so his son Crown Prince Munjong acted
								as regent for him. Although the appellation "the Great" /
								"(대왕;大王)" was given posthumously to almost every ruler of
								Goryeo and Joseon, this title is usually associated with
								Gwanggaeto and Sejong.
