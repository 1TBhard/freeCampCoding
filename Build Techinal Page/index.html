						Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
						efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
						approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
						dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
						ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
						many areas on most platforms.

						Before you start, you will need Python on your computer. Check
						whether you already have an up to date version of Python installed
						by entering python in a command line window. If you see a response
						from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its
						initial display. Generally any Python 3.x version will do, as Python
						makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility within major
						Python versions. Python 2.x and Python 3.x are intentionally not
						fully compatible. If python starts a Python 2.x interpreter, try
						entering python3 and see if an up to date version is already
						installed. On Windows, try py first - this is the relatively recent
						Python Launcher, which has a better chance of avoiding some of the
						path problems that might occur because on Windows programs don't
						install into any of the small set of common locations that are
						searched by default. The Python launcher can also let you select any
						of the various versions you may have installed from a single
						command. If you need to install Python, you may as well download the
						most recent stable version. This is the one with the highest number
						that isn't marked as an alpha or beta release. Please see
						<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"
							>the Python downloads page</a
						>
						a for the most up to date versions of Python. They are available via
						the yellow download buttons on that page.

						A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more
						descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python
						variables:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
							character
						</li>
						<li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
						<li>
							A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
							underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
						</li>
						<li>
							Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
							different variables)
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="main-section__content">
					<p>
						Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the
						examples above) are known as global variables. Global variables can
						be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
            >x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()          # Python is awesome</code>

					To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global
					keyword.

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
            >x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
    global x
    print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()            # Python is awesome</code>

			<section id="if_Statements" class="main-section">
				<header>if Statements</header>

				<div class="main-section__content">
					<p>
						Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For
						example:
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
          >if x &gt; 0:
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')</code>
					<p>
						There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.
						The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid
						excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a
						substitute for the switch or case statements found in other
						languages.
					</p>
				</div>

			<section id="for_Statements" class="main-section">
				<header>for Statements</header>

				<div class="main-section__content">
					<p>
						The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used
						to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic
						progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
						ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as
						C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
						(a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
						For example (no pun intended):
					</p>
					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
            ># Measure some strings:
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
    print(w, len(w))</code>
					<p>
						Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same
						collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more
						straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create
						a new collection:
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
          ># Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == 'inactive':
        del users[user]
          
# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == 'active':
        active_users[user] = status</code>
				</div>

			<section id="The_range_Function" class="main-section">
				<header>The range Function</header>

				<div class="main-section__content">
					<p>
						If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in
						function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic
						progressions:
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
          >for i in range(5):
    print(i)
... 
0
1
2
3
4</code>

					<p>
						The given end point is never part of the generated sequence;
						range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a
						sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at
						another number, or to specify a dif
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
          >range(5, 10)
5, 6, 7, 8, 9

range(0, 10, 3)
0, 3, 6, 9

range(-10, -100, -30)
-10, -40, -70</code>

					<p>
						To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine
						<code>range()</code> and <code>len()</code> as follows:
					</p>

					<!-- prettier-ignore -->
					<code
          >a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(i, a[i])
...
0 Mary
1 had
2 a
3 little
4 lamb</code>
